Pretty nice if you have a bare bones vim setup. It quickly adds some useful plugins and you can open straight into the runtime
env by simply typing "vim -u ~/.vimrc.go". Also this keeps your own ~/.vimrc intact.

Missing LUA support on my vim7.4 so needed some extra hoops to jump through... basically a full install and build of vim source

needed to add "set t_Co=256" in ~/.vim_go_runtime/custom_config.vim... i think this is where you do your usual vimrc settings etc
